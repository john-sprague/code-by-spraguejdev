            Hey ‚Äî I‚Äôm <span className="font-semibold">John Sprague</span>, a
            full-stack software engineer with a passion for building systems
            that serve real people. My path‚Äôs been unconventional: I left tech
            two in 2023 to build and run a regenerative farm and sourdough
            bakery from the ground up, and that journey reshaped how I think
            about growth, structure, and what matters.
