- `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, ...
- `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`

### Scopes
The `scope` provides additional contextual information.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Allowed Scopes depend on the specific project
* Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

### Breaking Changes Indicator
Breaking changes should be indicated by an `!` before the `:` in the subject line e.g. `feat(api)!: remove status endpoint`
- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Breaking changes **must** be described in the [commit footer section](#footer)

### Description
The `description` contains a concise description of the change.
- It is a **mandatory** part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
  - Think of `This commit will...` or `This commit should...`
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (`.`) at the end

### Body
The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

### Footer
The `footer` should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to **reference Issues** that this commit refers to.
- Is an **optional** part of the format
- **optionally** reference an issue by its id.
- **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

### Versioning
- **If** your next release contains commit with...
   - **breaking changes** incremented the **major version**
   - **API relevant changes** (`feat` or `fix`) incremented the **minor version**
- **Else** increment the **patch version**
